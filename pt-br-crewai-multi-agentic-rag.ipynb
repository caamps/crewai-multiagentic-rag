        "# Agentic RAG: Implementação utilizando CrewAI\n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic RAG é a implementação de um processo de RAG baseado em **agentes**. A capacidade de raciocínio e tomada de decisão dos agentes, geralmente construídos na arquitetura ReAct, pode melhorar significativamente o processo em relação ao RAG padrão. Algumas vantagens dessa estratégia são:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Flexibilidade nas fontes de dados:** Os agentes têm a capacidade de entender profundamente a necessidade e trabalhar com múltiplas fontes de dados, sejam dados textuais estáticos, bancos relacionais ou até mesmo a internet.\n",
        "* **Resolução de erros:** Os agentes podem lidar com problemas de forma efetiva, automatizando retries, mudando estratégias e pedindo esclarecimentos ao usuário.\n",
        "* **Contexto:** Em um RAG agêntico, há a consideração de interações anteriores e a manutenção de uma conversação humanizada e satisfatória.\n",
        "\n",
        "Este notebook demonstra o processo de criação de um RAG agêntico utilizando o CrewAI como orquestrador, além de algumas ferramentas do LangChain.\n",
        "\n",
        "O resultado final é um chat que pode ser utilizado como apoio para funcionários da área de suporte técnico de uma empresa. Nele, é possível consultar informações sobre tickets no sistema (por meio de um banco de dados SQL) ou orientações sobre como lidar com certos problemas ou situações (por meio de um manual PDF)."

        "* **LangChain**: Framework com diversas aplicações no contexto das LLMs. Neste projeto, foi utilizado para disponibilizar ferramentas à equipe do CrewAI. O SQL Database Toolkit permite a interação com bancos de dados, e o FAISS é uma base vetorial na memória que permite RAG semântico em texto. Além disso, a integração do LangChain com o AWS Bedrock foi utilizada para definir a LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) e o modelo de vetorização.\n",
